            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <p>Learning is pretty much a state of being for programming.  It isn't just learning new languages or technologies,
               it is learning how to understand what people want, and how to be organized.
               I was lucky enough to start reading The Pragmatic Programmer around a year after I really started coding.
                I was reviewing some of my older projects and found myself not understanding them.
