            <p class="abouttext">
                Hello, my name is Wayne Hall and I've become a giant nerd.  I wasn't always like this (well, I was, just nerdy about other things).  While I had loved playing around with code when I was younger, I never fully commited myself to it.  I went to school for another passion of mine, which was Urban Planning (Too much Sim City as a kid! Well, okay, as an adult too.).
                Shortly after college I found myself working for a property management company doing gobs of repeatitive paperwork.  At some point I began thinking "There must be another way... this needs to be able to be automated" and with that thought I began my journey.
                It started with some Excel formula's, took a turn toward Access databases, ramped up with Python but then detoured over to C# and .NET town.  Right now, I'm studying AngularJS (this site was made with AngularJS 1.5).  I've done some basic WinForms apps in C# that interacted with a database, I've done a basic ASP.NET MVC page that does the same.  I've done all of this in my spare time at my job.
            </p>
            <p class="abouttext"> The biggest thing that draws me to programming is the ability to make people's lives easier.  I started by wanting to make my own easier, then my co-workers, now I just love creating things for people that will help them.  As such, an emphasis of my learning is on data.  How to use it, how to store it, how to display it. Data makes the world work in most offices, and properly used will save almost any company time and money.</p>
